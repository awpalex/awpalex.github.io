      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I stumbled upon a great article by Alex Henderson &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.alexsguardian.net/posts/2022/07/02/LoggingSSHtoDiscord/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about using Discord as a platform to receive notifications on SSH login activity. This was incredibly useful in a blue team CTF I took part in a few months ago, as it gave us real-time notifications of the red team&amp;rsquo;s activity on our systems. This allowed us to respond to incidents quickly.&#xA;One issue we did face in the competition when using this method was that implementing it on the dozens of machines under our control took a long time, so during the competition I threw together a bash script that would perform all the necessary steps to get this working on a system. This script was however very quick &amp;amp; dirty and not worthy of being shared, but I thought I should create a better version after the competition ended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
